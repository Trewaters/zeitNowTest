# "project_name" - project_sub_title

version 0.1.0 or [version badge](https://badge.fury.io/)

An app that I use to get around San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit. I use BART everyday and it is nice to have an app I can trust to show me the next train.

## Getting Started

The BART scheduling app is a website that you can use to navigate BART. All you need is a cell/wifi signal and the app takes care of the rest.

### Prerequesites

### Installing

### Tests

### Coding Style

### Deployment

### What the app should do?

1.  If the user clicks on the "You are here" dropdown they will get a list of all the BART Train stations.
2.  When the user clicks on the "Destination Station" dropdown they should get a list of all the BART Train stations,

- minus(-) the station that is already loaded into the "You are here" dropdown. (Not finished)
- Once the user selects both a "You are here" & "Destination Station" the Trip Details button appears.

4.  If user clicks "Next Train" they get all the times of trains leaving the "You are here" station next.
5.  If user clicks "Trip Details" they get DETAILS of a trip originating at the "You are here" station and ending at the "Destination Station".
6.  Trip DETAILS =

- Train Time leaving "You are here" station next. Marked as "Original Station".
- All stations on the trip route in order of first to last, including arrival times. (Not finished)
- Ending with the "Destination Station" arrival tim. Marked as "Destination"
- Show Transfer station, if there is a transfer.
- Total trip time from start to end. (Not finished)
- BART messages about this trip.

# DEVELOPER SECTION (below)
## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Angular linting

Angular CLI has support for codelyzer. In order to validate your code with CLI and the custom Angular specific rules just use:
`ng new codelyzer`
`ng lint`
Note that by default all components are aligned with the style guide so you won't see any errors in the console.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
